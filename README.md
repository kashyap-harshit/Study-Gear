## What is this site?
This site works like a search engine. Whatever input the user gives, this site presents some videos related to that topic in front of you. This site does not own any of the searched videos. Apart from this feature, this site also provides you the monthly syllabus of your subject. For now this site supports only science stream.

## Why I made this site?
Firstly, I am also studying in 11th standard (2021 - 2022). When I wanted to start my 11th class I got very confused that which chapter to read first, from whom to read, etc. Then I thought that like me, other students must also be struggling. Then an idea came why not make such a platform where all the videos of all the education providers can be found at one place and in which month, which chapter should be read, it should also be known. With the same idea, I made this site thinking that other students like me atleast get some help.

## How to use this site?
Select the class first, then the subject or vice versa. After that you will be redirected to the page of Monthly Syllabus. You click on the chapter you need. After that you will be redirected to the search tool's page, where you will get videos from the top education providers. You can directly search topics from the Home page as well.

## Bugs?
If you find any please report.
